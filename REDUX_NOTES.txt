 Redux : Predictable state container for JS

 Every app -> think about what the data contained in the application is separately from what the view of the application is

 Redux -> data contained in the application -> Collection of all data that describes the app
 React -> View in the application

 In Redux, we centralize all of the application data inside a single object which we refer to as a state. This state is not component level state like in React. This is application level state.
 The other alternatives do not have the above (Angular, Flux)


 Counter Application :

 plus button      minus button

            Current Count : n


Data contained : Current Count
React: Current Count Display, NumberChanger
